                    <h1>About EDAssets</h1>
                    <p>
                        EDAssets was created by CMDR SpyTec and CMDR Garud. All the code for EDAssets is available on <a href="https://www.github.com/SpyTec/EDAssets">GitHub</a>.
                        <br>
                        If you wish to contact EDAssets regarding new assets you can either do that on <a href="https://github.com/SpyTec/EDAssets/issues/new">GitHub</a> or send an <a href="mailto:spytec@protonmail.ch?subject=[EDAssets]">email</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is EDAssets?</h3>
                    <p>EDAssets is a community website striving to be the main source of consuming concept-art, imagery, icons, and animated logos from Elite Dangerous.</p>
                    <h3>Requesting an asset</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you want an icon from the game or other assets, you can request it through GitHub. If you want to take matters into your own hands and provide a vector to use on the website, feel free to create either an issue with the assets attached or a Pull-Request.
                        <br>

                    <h3>Credits</h3>
                    <p>
                        All assets added to the website have credits associated with them on the website. Those listed here have helpt in other ways: Garud and Moozipan!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Donating</h3>
                    <p>
                        Currently the only cost for EDAssets is the domain. I spend time vectorising assets whenever I feel like it as it takes up a lot of work. If you want an asset done ASAP buying me a coffee will make me do the asset faster. :)
